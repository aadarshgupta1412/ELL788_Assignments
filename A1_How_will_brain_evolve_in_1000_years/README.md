# Hypothesis
The purpose of the research article is to envisage the pattern of evolution of the human brain in the forthcoming 1000 years. The changes observed in the evolution till date were integrated with current work in the area and futuristic technological ideas to give an idea of 
the same, while keeping in mind the physical and biological constraints. Evolutionary factors suggest small theoretical growth of brain size for better efficiency, although recent studies conclude 
dietary, environmental, and social factors might lead to shrinkage of brain and its capabilities as we witnessed in the last few millennia. Environmental impact will play a crucial role in the development of 
the brain although thermodynamic limitations of the human body and feasible neurological limits of the brain sets an upper bound for growth. Evolution processes of communication and anatomy of the 
human body will influence the mechanism of brain evolution. However, recent patterns of brain size reduction and efficiency limitations might be reversed with the incorporation of genetic engineering in the area. Brain-machine interface (BMIs) would prove 
to be a key domain in shaping up the future of H. Sapiens and the proportion of integration in human lives could well determine evolution of newer species such as H. cyberneticus or H. hybridus.However, it is to be noted that these ameliorations would take place 
for a small section of fraternity only and decline in mental abilities and brain shrinkage would imply that a major part of society would survive on the back of the technology-assisted faction.
