## Abstract:
The recent explosion of speech-driven interfaces has had a significant impact on users' lifestyles, however there are still some constraints to the utility of such technology for the mute and those with speaking disabilities due to the requisite speech and physical gestures. The use of imagined speech using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is an alluring domain of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as it enables effective communication strategies for controlling devices using speech directives extracted from brain signals. This systematic review examines viable datasets and architectures for the purpose of finding opportunities for various imaging modalities to establish directions for recognition of speech from the brain signals. This study investigates novel EEG data processing techniques, examines three widely used databases: KARA ONE, BD1, and BD2 and evaluates effective modalities based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), LSTMs, and various deep learning architectures on a range of different of speech recognition tasks. Eventually, our work reinforces the validity of a brain imagery footprint that may be used to aid in the decoding of imagined speech in a range of real-world applications and devices.
